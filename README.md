# An Automated Irrigation System for Home Gardening

## Problem statement :
The current methods of moisture management are associated with imprecise measurements, inconsistent plant hydration, and additional labor requirements. This project is to develop an automated robotic system capable of autonomously providing irrigation to plants, monitoring their health, and facilitating their growth with minimal human intervention.

## Objective: 
1. Enhanced plant development and growth.
2. Reduce manual intervention.
3. Water conservation.
4. Resource efficiency.
5. Reduced expenses.
6. Environmental sustainability.

## Features: 
1. Monitoring the soil's moisture.
2. Monitoring the air humidity.
3. Sense and respond automatically using sensors.
4. Real Time monitoring.
5. Getting information of insufficient moisture .
6. User friendly interface.
## Tools and devices: 
1. D1 mini
2. Soil Moisture Sensor
3. Relay
4. Pump
5. Temperature and humidity sensor(DHT11)
6. LCD screen
7. Battery
8. Cables and wires

## References:
Manual irrigation is frequently observed to have a positive impact on plant development and growth. However, it is important to note that this method requires a significant amount of labor which can lead to human errors and a lack of understanding regarding the specific demands of plants. Our motivation is to design and implement a self-adjusting robotic system capable of effectively dealing with irrigation to agricultural crops, check their condition, and promote blossoming with minimal human interaction. This system aims to be convenient and accessible for the general population.
